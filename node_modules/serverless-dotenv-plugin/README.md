# serverless-dotenv-plugin [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/serverless-dotenv-plugin.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-dotenv-plugin)

Preload Environment Variables Into Serverless

Use this plugin if you have variables stored in a `.env` file that you want loaded into your serverless yaml config. This will allow you to reference them as `${env:VAR_NAME}` inside your config _and_ it will load them into your lambdas.

### Install and Setup

First, install the plugin:

```
> npm i -D serverless-dotenv-plugin
```

Next, add the plugin to your serverless config file:

```
service: myService
plugins:
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin
...
```

Now, just like you would using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in any other JS application, create your `.env` file in the root of your app:

```
DYANMODB_TABLE=myTable
AWS_REGION=us-west-1
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=abc12345
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=12345xyz
```

#### Automatic Env file name resolution

By default, the plugin looks for the file: `.env`. In most use cases this is all that is needed. However, there are times where you want different env files based on environment. For instance:

```
.env.development
.env.production
```

When you deploy with `NODE_ENV` set: `NODE_ENV=production sls deploy` the plugin will look for a file named `.env.production`. If it doesn't exist it will default to `.env`. If for some reason you can't set NODE_ENV, you could always just pass it in as an option: `sls deploy --env production`. If `NODE_ENV` or `--env` is not set, it will default to `development`.

| Valid .env file names | Description                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .env                  | Default file name when no other files are specified or found.                                       |
| .env.development      | If NODE_ENV or --env **is not set**, will try to load `.env.development`. If not found, load `.env` |
| .env.{ENV}            | If NODE_ENV or --env **is set**, will try to load `.env.{env}`. If not found, load `.env`           |

### Plugin options

By default, the dotenv package will look for your .env file in the same folder where you run the command, but this can be customized by setting the `path` option. Also, be default, ALL env vars found in your file will be injected into your lambda functions. If you do not want all of them to be injected into your lambda functions, you can whitelist them with the `include` option.

```
custom:
  dotenv:
    path: ../../.env
    include:
      - AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
      - AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Note, it is not recommended you use a custom path. Doing so overrides the automatic file resolution as described above.

### Usage

Once loaded, you can now access the vars using the standard method for accessing ENV vars in serverless:

```
...
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs6.10
  stage: ${env:STAGE}
  region: ${env:AWS_REGION}
...
```

### Lambda Environment Variables

Again, remember that when you deploy your service, the plugin with inject these environment vars into any lambda functions you have and will therefore allow you to reference them as `process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` (Nodejs example).

### Examples

You can find example usage in the `examples` folder.
